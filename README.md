# Improve User App Engagement
This project uses user data to explore how to increase app user usage/engagement. Three data files were used (not included in this directory):

1. app_usage.csv shows how many times each user used the meditation app across 14 days. So, a value of “4” for a given day means they accessed the app 4 times that day. In this file, NAs mean we lost our connection with this user’s phone due to a technical error, and do not have usage data for these individuals on those days. 
2. survey_responses.csv contains responses to some short user experience surveys given to participants in-app. All questions in this survey were asked on a 1 to 7 scale. The “sign up” survey was given immediately after the user signed up for the app; the “post-14 days” survey was given 14 days after the user downloaded the app. 
3. emographics.csv contains the demographics we know about these users.
