# Improve User App Engagement
This project uses user data to explore how to increase app user usage/engagement. Three data files were used (not included in this directory):

1. app_usage.csv shows how many times each user used the app across 14 days
2. survey_responses.csv contains responses to user experience surveys given to participants in-app (questions were asked on a 1 to 7 scale)
3. demographics.csv contains the demographics.
